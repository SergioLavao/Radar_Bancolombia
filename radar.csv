Its out-of-the-box implementation of cross-cutting concerns — such as service discovery, service-to-service and origin-to-service security, observability (including telemetry and distributed tracing), rolling releases and resiliency — has been bootstrapping our microservices implementations very quickly. It's the main implementation of the <a href=""/radar/techniques/service-mesh"">service mesh</a> technique we've been using. We've been enjoying its monthly releases and its continuous improvements with seamless upgrades. We use Istio to bootstrap our projects, starting with observability (tracing and telemetry) and service-to-service security. We're closely watching its improvements to service-to-service authentication everywhere in and outside of the mesh. We'd also like to see Istio establish best practices for configuration files to strike a balance between giving autonomy to service developers and control to the service mesh operators.</p>"

Securing a Kubernetes cluster is a wide and nuanced topic, but we highly recommend setting up Tiller in a role-based access control (RBAC) environment. We've used Helm in a number of client projects and its dependency management, templating and hook mechanism has greatly simplified the application lifecycle management in Kubernetes. However, we recommend proceeding with caution â€” Helm's <a href=""/radar/techniques/templating-in-yaml"">YAML templating</a> can be difficult to understand, and Tiller still has some rough edges.

Secrets as a service,adoptar,arquitecturas-y-patrones,FALSE,"<p>Humans and machines use secrets throughout the value stream of building and operating software. The build pipelines need secrets to interface with secure infrastructures such as container registries, the applications use API keys as secrets to get access to business capabilities, and the service-to-service communications are secured using certificates and keys as secrets. You can set and retrieve these secrets in different ways. We've long cautioned developers about using source code management for storing secrets. We've recommended <a href=""/radar/techniques/decoupling-secret-management-from-source-code"">decoupling secret management from source code</a> and using tools such as <a href=""/radar/tools/git-secrets"">git-secrets</a> and <a href=""/radar/tools/talisman"">Talisman</a> to avoid storing secrets in the source code. We've been using <strong>secrets as a service</strong> as a default technique for storing and accessing secrets. With this technique you can use tools such as <a href=""/radar/tools/hashicorp-vault"">Vault</a> or <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a> to read/write secrets over an HTTPS endpoint with fine-grained levels of access control. Secrets as a service uses external identity providers such as <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/iam/"">AWS IAM</a> to identify the actors who request access to secrets. Actors authenticate themselves with the secrets service. For this process to work, it's important to automate bootstrapping the identity of the actors, services and applications.

Service mesh,evaluar,arquitecturas-y-patrones,FALSE,"<p><strong>Service mesh</strong> is an approach to operating a secure, fast and reliable microservices ecosystem. It has been an important stepping stone in making it easier to adoptar microservices at scale. It offers discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling. It provides these cross-functional capabilities without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or baking libraries into each service. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes, aka sidecars, deployed alongside each service process in a separate container. Sidecars intercept the inbound and outbound traffic of each service and provide cross-functional capabilities mentioned above. This approach has relieved the distributed service teams from building and updating the capabilities that the mesh offers as code in their services. This has lead to an even easier adoptarion of <a href=""/radar/techniques/polyglot-programming"">polyglot programming</a> in a microservices ecosystem. Our teams have been successfully using this approach with open source projects such as <a href=""/radar/platforms/istio"">Istio</a> and we will continue to monitor other open service mesh implementations such as <a href=""http://linkerd.io/"">Linkerd</a> closely.</p>" 
Templating in YAML,adoptar,arquitecturas-y-patrones,FALSE,"<p>As infrastructures grow in complexity, so do the configuration files that define them. Tools such as <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"">AWS CloudFormation</a>, <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a> and <a href=""/radar/tools/helm"">Helm</a> expect configuration files in JSON or YAML syntax, presumably in an attempt to make them easy to write and process. However, in most cases, teams quickly reach the point where they have some parts that are similar but not quite the same, for example, when the same service must be deployed in different regions with a slightly different setup. For such cases tools offer <strong>templating in YAML</strong> (or JSON), which has caused a huge amount of <a href=""https://leebriggs.co.uk/blog/2019/02/07/why-are-we-templating-yaml.html"">frustration with practitioners</a>. The problem is that the syntax of JSON and YAML requires all sorts of awkward compromises to graft templating features such as conditionals and loops into the files. We recommend using an API from a programming language instead or, when this is not an option, a templating system in a programming language, either a general-purpose language such as Python or something specialized such as <a href=""https://jsonnet.org/"">Jsonnet</a>.</p>"
