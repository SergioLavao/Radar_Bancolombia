Our developers favor its minimal configuration management, well-integrated IDE support and its ability to refactor code safely and gradually adopt types. With its <a href=""https://definitelytyped.org/"">good repository</a> of TypeScript-type definitions at hand, we benefit from all the rich JavaScript libraries while gaining type safety.</p> ";;;;;;;;;;;
